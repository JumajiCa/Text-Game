# Text-Game

* Some Sort Of List Dictating What I'll Have To Do For The Forseeable Future. 

## Project Description. 

* This is just the jumble of ideas that I've had for a very long time inside of my head in a real text - based game, with future prospects of making whatever comes out of this venture into a real game that doesn't just run inside of the terminal, though that is a long ways to come. 

* The game is going to be made primarily in C++, though if I can wrap my head around how to do it, and whether or not I'm proactive enough to do so, I may add other more memory - safe languages to the codebase for tasks that I have no right to work with at such a low level, though I don't know if this statement even makes sense, as I do not know whether or not interoperability between languages like Rust and C++ is even a thing. 

## To - Do. 

* I'll start putting the tasks that I need to do to finish this game in the near future.
